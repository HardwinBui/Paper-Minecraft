# Paper Minecraft
<h2>Introduction</h2>

Paper Minecraft is a simplified 2D version of Minecraft that I developed in C++ and OpenGL. This project is the first time I've developed a game without a game engine. 
Some of the features I implemented include:
- terrain generation using perlin noise
- displaying sprites and changing the camera view using GLSL
- updating images to be draw on the window
